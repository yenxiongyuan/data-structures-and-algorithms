# Stack Queue Animal Shelter


## Challenge

* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
* The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:

* Methods:
     * enqueue
          * Arguments: animal
               * animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
               * It must have a species property that is either "cat" or "dog"
               * It must have a name property that is a string.

    * dequeue
          * Arguments: pref
               * pref can be either "dog" or "cat".
               * Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.
